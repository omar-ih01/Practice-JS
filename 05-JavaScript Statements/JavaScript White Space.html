    <pre>JavaScript ignores multiple spaces.
         You can add white space to your script to make it more readable. 
        The following lines are equivalent:
         var person = "Hege"; 
         var person="Hege"; 
         
         A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ): 
         var x = y + z;</pre>
