    <p>Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.</p>
    <p>Multiplication has precedence over addition.</p>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 100 + 50 * 3;
    </script>
    <br>
    <pre>
        Is the result of example above the same as 150 * 3, or is it the same as 100 + 150?

Is the addition or the multiplication done first?

As in traditional school mathematics, the multiplication is done first.

Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).

And (as in school mathematics) the precedence can be changed by using parentheses:
    </pre>
    <p>Multiplication has precedence over addition</p>
    <p>But parenthesis has precedence over multiplication</p>
    <p>When using parentheses, the operations inside the parentheses are computed first.</p>

    <p id="demoo"></p>

    <script>
        document.getElementById("demoo").innerHTML = (100 + 50) * 3;
    </script>
    <br>
    <p>When many operations have the same precedence (like addition and subtraction), they are computed from left to right:</p>
    <p id="demon"></p>
    <script>
        document.getElementById("demon").innerHTML = 100 + 50 - 3;
    </script>
